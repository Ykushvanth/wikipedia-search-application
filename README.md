# wikipedia-search-application
This set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code creates a Wikipedia search web application. The HTML structure defines a search bar and a container to display search results. The CSS styles the elements for a clean and modern look, including font imports from Google Fonts and Bootstrap-like styling for the search bar. The JavaScript adds functionality to the search bar, allowing users to enter a keyword and press Enter to fetch search results from the Wikipedia API. While the search is in progress, a spinner is displayed, and once the results are retrieved, they are dynamically rendered on the page with clickable titles and URLs to the Wikipedia pages.
